**[AmberELEC](https://github.com/AmberELEC/AmberELEC/releases) and [ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki#download-links):**
- rk3326-r35s-linux.dtb is the file with the working FN Button
- You'd have to edit the boot.ini file on your boot folder or use my provided boot.ini file.
---
> [!NOTE]  
>Newer R33S/R35S/R36S consoles are coming with 4 new updated screens. If your brand new R33S/R35S/R36S doesn't work with the usual DTB files look at the new screens folder and try which one works for you.
